The dataset is a representation of fictional data about high school students' performance on a multi-subject exam, based on environmental and economic status factors.
TO DO:
Define end result goals, functionality wise as well as statistically/visually (graphs/charts).

Preprocessing is likely useless, however we can still try.

Import data CSV into Python using Pandas

Understand data structure; iterate through data, assign columns to variables, etc.

Potentially organize/categorize data (e.g., by gender, parental college).

Use Scikit-learn to implement algorithms.

Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train each model using the training data.
Evaluate data models

accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Create data visualization

ex. matplotlib, create graphs, charts, etc.
Analyze data results

Relationships between variables-- correlation, causation, similarities, etc.
Document code, and keep track of results/statistics

Create Report

TO INSTALL REQUIREMENTS: pip install -r requirements.txt
